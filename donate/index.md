- title: THE SUBSTATION COMMISSIONING PROGRAM
  copy: "The SUBSTATION COMMISSIONING PROGRAM offers local independent artists the
    opportunity to develop, create and present a significant body of work. The program
    provides each artist with time, space and resources to develop their work, from
    concept to presentation over an extended period and in close collaboration with
    The SUBSTATION.  Commissioning Program Donors will be invited in to see first-hand
    the creative process from beginning to end, through development to presentation
    of each new commission. \n\nAll donations are tax deductible and go directly to
    the artists to create and present the new commissions.  \n \nThe selected artists
    all work in the spaces between traditional art forms and have been invited to
    realise a significant new work of scale within the unique architectural spaces
    of The SUBSTATION.\n"
