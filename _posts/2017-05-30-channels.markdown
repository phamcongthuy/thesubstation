CHANNELS, The Australian Video Art Festival is the only festival dedicated to showcasing new contemporary moving image by some of the most exciting Australian and international artists. 

In 2017, CHANNELS looks to the future. In dialogue with artists, curators and the community, CHANNELS poses an open question about the future and speculative narratives, which explore histories yet to be established. The theme ‘futures’ is an invitation to artists and collaborators who are experimental and innovative with their medium and ideas, exploring future selves, ideas, movements, politics and technologies.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and CHANNELS.

[**FUTURE TENSE**](https://thesubstation.org.au/whats-on/future-tense/)<br>
1 September - 28 October

**FESTIVAL CLOSING PARTY** <br>
**AUTOFICTIONS**<br>
**SATURDAY 9 SEPTEMBER, 9PM**<br>
Choose your channel as we guide you through speculative visions of the future with performances by [RACHEL MASON (US)](http://www.rachelannmason.com/), HANNAH BRONTË, [JESSWAR](https://www.facebook.com/Jesswaaaaar/), [CLUB D’ERANGE](https://www.facebook.com/clubderange) and the D’erange Dance Guides, underscored with sub-sounds by [LIQUID ARCHITECTURE](http://www.liquidarchitecture.org.au/) and moving image by XANTHE DOBBIE as they take control of stage and screen.

**[KIHLBERG & HENRY](http://www.karinkihlberg-reubenhenry.org/) (UK)**<br>
**A MOUNTAIN CLOSE UP IS ONLY ROCK** <BR>
CHANNELS presents the Australian premiere of the video installation work, A MOUNTAIN
CLOSE UP IS ONLY ROCK by KIHLBERG & HENRY. 

Co-commissioned by the FOUNDATION FOR ART AND CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY (FACT, UK) and CHANNELS, A MOUNTAIN CLOSE UP IS ONLY ROCK forms a passage through the digital footprint of architect JØRN UTZON, guiding the viewer through an abstract archaeology that draws connections between the built environment and the landscape of the brain.

Narrated by a series of unfixed voices, the video envisions an obscure afterlife in the traces of the architect’s mythical house on Mallorca, its geographic location kept private and its evidence scant.

**[CAROLINE GARCIA](http://carolinegarcia.com.au/)** <br>
**FLYGIRL** <br>
**THURSDAY 7 SEPTEMBER, 6PM** <br>
FLYGIRL is a solo dance installation that reimagines forgotten hip-hop routines. The work consists of choreographic interludes that meticulously samples performances by the all-female troupe of Fly Girls from the early nineties American TV series, IN LIVING COLOR. Developed and performed by CAROLINE GARCIA, FLYGIRL playfully touches on nostalgic sentiments and memories as a visual backdrop to the politics of hip-hop
culture.

Supported by Australia Council for the Arts Residency with EMPAC and Critical Path.

**JESSIE SCOTT** <br>
**SLOW CANCELLATION** <br>
Slow Cancellation is a GIF making workshop with the artist JESSIE SCOTT. Participants will explore early digital GIF formats and contemporary forms of animation and learn about how artists use both to create contemporary artworks, before making a GIF of their own. The GIFs will be presented in a pop up exhibition in the foyer of Incinerator Gallery and hosted on the CHANNELS website.

**AUGMENTED REALITY TOUR** <br>
**KATE GECK** <br>
**RELAXATION AGENCY RLX:TECH**<br>
**Location: Newport Retail precinct** <br> Channels presents a new commission by Melbourne-based artist Kate Geck. Relaxation Agency RLX:tech is a series of installations of therapeutic, interactive totems among businesses around Newport’s retail precinct. <br>
These artisan objects are designed for the home or business, and trigger relaxing content for contemporary audiences to alleviate the stressors of constant connectivity. Facilitated by your own device, these markers lead you on a relaxing, mindful walk around Newport. They trigger guided meditations and 3D talismans to help you forget about not liking your boss’s selfie, or to deal with a recent unfriending. RLX:tech creates furnishings for a future world: designing your interactions with devices to be therapeutic. We purposefully integrate technology into your spaces to make you feel better. <br>
Supported by THE HOBSONS BAY CITY COUNCIL ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM.
