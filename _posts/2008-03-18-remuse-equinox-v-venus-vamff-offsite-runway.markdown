On the new moon prior to the Autumnal Equinox, Equinox V Vênus will teleport you into the cosmic realm of Naarm based REMUSE through a runway performance of sight and sound. 

Showcasing the label's Equinox V / Autumn 2018 collection in collaboration with select musicians, performance and installation artists. 

All ticket profits will be donated directly to [ISER Caribe](https://isercaribe.org/), Puerto Rico based humanitarian and environmental conservation organisation formed after Hurricane Maria humanitarian, and curated as part of the VAMFF Offsite Runway Program.
