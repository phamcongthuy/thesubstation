## THE SUBSTATION

During her residency at The SUBSTATION, [MARGIE MEDLIN](https://unsited.org/2016/01/20/160/) will research two projects. One, a dance and media public art project that links incidental spectators with large-scale video dance projections and mobile image technologies. 

Research associates include VICKI VAN HOUT, PATRICK LUCKY LARTEY, ANNA TREGLOAN & MARTIN FOX. The second project in collaboration with PROFESSOR HOLGER DEUTER from the University of Applied Sciences in Kaiserslautern, Germany, researches the theme of weapons design and media technologies.  

[MARGIE MEDLIN](https://unsited.org/2016/01/20/160/) is an artist, designer and curator. Her work explores the relationship between dance and the moving image, space and light. MEDLIN has created many, varied multi-screen movement performances and installations using technologies ranging from analogue through to state of the art digital systems utilising live video, motion capture, motion control and robotics.
