Colonial constructs of Australian identity have politically and culturally distanced Australia from its geographical neighbours. Despite this, and in the face of the immigration restriction act, the Asian communities have had a long and significant history of contributing to Australia. 

HYPHENATED presents the work of a number of contemporary Asian-Australian artists living locally in Victoria, offering varying perspectives of issues, from the personal to the global, through a hyphenated lens.

Exhibiting artists include [RUSHDI ANWAR](http://www.rushdi.com.au/), [SOFI BASSEGHI](http://sofibasseghi.com/) AND EHSAN KHOSHNAMI, ANDY BUTLER, [RHETT D’COSTA](http://art.rmit.edu.au/people/rhett-dcosta/), [TAMMY WONG HULBERT](http://www.tammywonghulbert.com/), [NIKKI LAM](http://nikkilam.info/), [EUGENIA LIM](http://www.eugenialim.com/), [HOANG TRAN NGUYEN](http://hoangtrannguyen.com/htn.html), [SLIPPAGE](http://www.slippage.com.au/) and [VIPOO SRIVILASA](http://vipoo.com/).

Presented by The SUBSTATION.

RMIT University’s Contemporary Art and Social Transformation (CAST) will host a symposium on Art and Inter-cultural Identity in conjunction with the exhibition on 28 March, 5pm-7pm, The Storey Hall, Green Brain Conference Room, Level 7.
