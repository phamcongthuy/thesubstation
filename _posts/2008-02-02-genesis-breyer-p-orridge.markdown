Legendary English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance, and visual artist [GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE](https://www.facebook.com/Genesis-BREYER-P-ORRIDGE-171735929627691/) performs live on stage with EDLEY ODOWD, who together tour as [PSYCHIC TV](https://www.facebook.com/psychictvptv3/). 

P-ORRIDGE rose to notability as founder of the COUM Transmissions art collective, which operated in Britain from 1969 to 1976. P-Orridge fronted the pioneering industrial band [THROBBING GRISTLE](http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/) between 1975 and 1981 and the experimental multimedia commonage PSYCHIC TV from 1981 to present. 

New York based artist and percussionist EDLEY ODOWD has been collaborating with cultural luminary GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE for the last 15 years as PSYCHIC TV, which GENESIS calls h/er "favourite line-up ever". ODOWD also produces and manages the band in addition to creating its graphic design visuals since the bands reactivation in 2003.

Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with [ROOM 40](http://room40.org/) as part of [MIDSUMMA FESTIVAL](https://midsumma.org.au/)
