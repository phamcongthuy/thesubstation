Legendary English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance, and visual artist [GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE](https://www.facebook.com/Genesis-BREYER-P-ORRIDGE-171735929627691/) performs live on stage with EDLEY ODOWD, who together tour as [PSYCHIC TV](https://www.facebook.com/psychictvptv3/). 

P-ORRIDGE rose to notability as founder of the COUM Transmissions art collective, which operated in Britain from 1969 to 1976. P-Orridge fronted the pioneering industrial band [THROBBING GRISTLE](http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/) between 1975 and 1981 and the experimental multimedia commonage PSYCHIC TV from 1981 to present. 

New York based artist and percussionist EDLEY ODOWD has been collaborating with cultural luminary GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE for the last 15 years as PSYCHIC TV, which GENESIS calls h/er "favourite line-up ever". ODOWD also produces and manages the band in addition to creating its graphic design visuals since the bands reactivation in 2003.

[CAT HOPE](http://www.cathope.com/)'s music uses graphic scores, acoustic/electronic combinations and new score reading technologies, featuring aleatoric elements, drone, noise, glissandi and an ongoing fascination with low frequency sound. Described as “one of the most important voices of modern Australian music”, HOPE’s compositions range from works for laptop duet to orchestra, with a focus on chamber works and the physicality of sound in different media.

Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with [ROOM 40](http://room40.org/) as part of [MIDSUMMA FESTIVAL](https://midsumma.org.au/)
