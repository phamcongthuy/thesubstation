## COVE PARK, SCOTLAND

The SUBSTATION has partnered with [Cryptic](http://www.cryptic.org.uk/), Glasgow to offer a reciprocal artist residency between the two organisations. Based about an hour north of Glasgow, Cove Park offers residencies that respond to the diversity of contemporary artistic practice of all art forms. In 2017, Cove Park will host Sydney-based sound artist [GAIL PRIEST](http://www.gailpriest.net/). PRIESTâ€™s work comprises solo electro-acoustic performance and recordings, sound installations for gallery contexts, sound design for performance and video, as well as curation, critique and advocacy.

A partnership between The SUBSTATION and Cryptic, Glasgow.
