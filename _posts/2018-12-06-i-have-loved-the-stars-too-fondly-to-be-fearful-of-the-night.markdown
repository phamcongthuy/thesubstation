In this immersive installation of improvised light and sound, a single human body becomes an abstracted focal point — a disembodied drishti – within an unfolding science fiction odyssey. The work explores states of transition and the synergy between light, sound and the body, offering audiences a meditation on time, perspective and the moment of death.
