Hi-Viz Practice Exchange is a new Chamber Made initiative for women working across performance, sound and music. It's is a day of discussions, exchanges, and interactions aimed at deepening dialogue around cross-artform practice. Hi-Viz is for everyone in this space, from emerging to established artists. Hi-Viz is designed to bring women performance-makers, directors, composers, and sound artists into conversation with one another.
