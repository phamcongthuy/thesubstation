Madeleine Flynn and Tim Humphrey will undertake a residency at Cove Park Scotland supported by [Cryptic Glasgow](http://www.cryptic.org.uk/cove-parkresidency- programme/) and The SUBSTATION. 

During this residency, they will work on a new sound-visual interactive setup and performance model, working title All The Feedback We Ever Had. 

Madeleine Flynn and Tim Humphrey are Australian artists who create unexpected situations for listening. Their work is driven by a curiosity and questioning about sound in human culture and seeks to evolve and engage with new processes and audiences, through public and participative interventions. In 2017 their practice was awarded the national Australia Council Award for Emerging and Experimental Artforms. 

Their work has been presented and commissioned widely internationally including Theater Der Welt, Germany: Brighton Festival UK: Sonica Festival Glasgow: Asian Arts Theater, Gwangju: Incheon Art Platform, Seoul: Sydney Festival Australia: Melbourne Festival Australia: AsiaTopa, Melbourne: Perth Festival Australia: MONA FOMA Australia: Kennedy Center, Washington USA amongst many others. Their current areas of interest are existential risk, artificial intelligence in public space, and long form socially engaged public art interventions.
