Women of the World take over, because if you don't the world will come to an end, and we haven't got long.

From the makers of THIS IS WHAT’S HAPPENING, BLOWIN’ UP and FALLEN O’ER — LADY EXAMPLE, is a deranged and exquisite stocktake of history to propose a feminine future. Let us turn to our lady examples.

Created and performed by ALICE DIXON, CAROLINE MEADEN and WILLIAM MCBRIDE with an ensemble of artists. 

Sound by EMAH FOX. <br>
Lighting by JASON CRICK. <br> 
Design by MATILDA WOODROOFE. <br>
