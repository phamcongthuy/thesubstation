NONCOMPETE is a post-human music, sculpture and installation featuring new electro-mechanical robotic instruments with hundreds of moving parts.

Exploring multi-room instrumentation, robotic music and programmatic composition, ALISDAIR MACINDOE's work reflects on the idea that digital technology is a new life-form we are currently gestating. NONCOMPETE explores the inevitable point where technology has agency and its own agenda.Â
