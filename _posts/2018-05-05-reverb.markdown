Reverberation, in psychoacoustics and acoustics, is a persistence of sound after the sound is produced. A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound or signal is reflected causing a large number of reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space â€“ which could include furniture, people, and air. This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they reach zero amplitude.

After a 2 year hiatus and sell out shows across the globe, Detroit Techno Militia return to Australian soil to deliver another high impact performance of 2 x 4 which is a combined ensemble performance by T.Linder & DJ Seoul playing 100% vinyl only on 2 mixers and 4 turntables at the same time - no computers or controllers at all!
As an added bonus T.Linder is going to unleash his arsenal of signature electro bass form the legendary AUX 88, Drexciya and Kraftwerk through to modern masters like Dj Godfather, Will Web and the man himself T.Linder with a killer solo performance that's not to be missed.

It's the return of techno & electro to a warehouse environment. 

Presented by Stable Music Co and The SUBSTATION.
