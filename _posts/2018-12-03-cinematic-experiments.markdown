**Cinematic Experiments** is a playful interactive multi-media installation in which early cinema techniques and digital dance are layered and animated.

Starting with a library of analogue and digital source material, media artists **Margie Medlin**, **Rhian Hinkley**, **Olaf Meyer** and **James Wilkinson** will devise a series of experiments that combine motion graphics with digital dance choreography by V**icki Van Hout** and **Patrick Lucky Lartey**. The project invites audiences to bring a sense of curiosity and explore their own movement in relation to this dynamic and frequently changing installation.
