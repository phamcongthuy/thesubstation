Over the past 10 years, Lawrence English has been one of the leading international voices in field recording. Working extensively across the world, from Antarctica to the Outback and the Amazon to Japan, his recordings display an utterly personal approach informed equally by technique,
theoretical investigations and aesthetic interests.

It is these unique approaches to field recording that form the basis of this masterclass. The Radical Listener sees Lawrence English guide participants through the specific techniques of field recording and listening he employs in his work. Participants can be at any stage of their interest in field recording from beginner to expert and can use any recording device they have
available (iphone through to profession set ups).

Join LAWRENCE ENGLISH for a workshop in field recording, sound documentation, manipulation and archiving around The SUBSTATION’s surrounding area. 

Limited number of tickets available.

THEMBI SODDELL’s LOVE SONGS is assisted by the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its arts funding and advisory body.
