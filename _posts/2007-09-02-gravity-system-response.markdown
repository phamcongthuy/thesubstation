Exploring the energy of paint, air, water and gravity combined, GRAVITY SYSTEM RESPONSE is a
series of six canvas panels by renowned Melbourne-based artist, [ASH KEATING](https://www.facebook.com/ashkeatingartist/).

Installed on The SUBSTATION billboards, the work is a broad study of colour and its emotive properties,
with swathes of yellows, reds, pinks, magenta and white fields folding in on one another. Cascading down the surface, each intricate variation across the interconnected panels marks the passing of time spent
spraying, washing and waiting, exposing KEATINGâ€™s borderline obsessive commitment to the repetitious
and ritualistic layering of paint.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and ASH KEATING.
