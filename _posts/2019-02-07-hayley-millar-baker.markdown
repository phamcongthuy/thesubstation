**Ngathoongan Pawa (We Eat)** is a suit of selected works from the series **Cook Book**. **Ngathoongan Pawa (We Eat) ** explores the merging of traditional Aboriginal cultural practices of hunting and cooking with Westernised 21st century knowledges and tools. As Aboriginal people, we have passed down stories to the next generation for hundreds of centuries in order to preserve timeless knowledges and our way of life – even through the onslaught of change that invasion and forced assimilation brought with it. 

> HAYLEY MILLAR-BAKER  is a Gunditjmara woman from Victoria, Australia. Through contemporary approaches to photography, she draws strength from her Gunditjmara bloodlines, history, and the landscape – confronting and crafting past, present, and future stories of South-East Aboriginal existence, and honouring the connectedness of intergenerational experiences of Aboriginality. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [YIRRAMBOI Festival](https://yirramboi.net.au/).
