[FOREST FRINGE](http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/) X [MELBOURNE FRINGE](https://melbournefringe.com.au/) is an innovative residency project bringing together local and international artists to explore the streets and spaces of Melbourneâ€™s West. The project brings award-winning Edinburgh Fringe Festival innovators FOREST FRINGE (UK) to Melbourne for the first time, joining forces with MELBOURNE FRINGE, our own big, bold and gloriously messy celebration of independent art. 

We invite you to join us for the culmination of FOREST FRINGE X MELBOURNE FRINGE, as the artists involved take over the SUBSTATION with experiments, interventions, talks and reflections on the work of the residency. Led by FOREST FRINGE co-directors ANDY FIELD and DEBORAH PEARSON, we invite you to test the results of their experiments, listen, play, change your mind and then change it again.

For full program information and tickets visit this page or [melbournefringe.com.au](https://melbournefringe.com.au/) from 10 August.
