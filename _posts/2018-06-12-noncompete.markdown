NONCOMPETE is a post-human music, sculpture and installation featuring new electro-mechanical robotic instruments with hundreds of moving parts.

ALISDAIR MACINDOEâ€™s work is a musical reflection on the idea that digital technology is a new life that we are currently gestating and though it is made by us and reflects our development, the point where technology has agency and its own agenda is inevitable.
