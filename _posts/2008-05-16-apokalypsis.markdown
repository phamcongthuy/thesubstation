Four performers. One hundred apocalypses. Sixty minutes.

Beginning with the Big Bang and hurtling through wars, famines, kingdoms collapsing, extinctions and dictatorships, APOKALYPSIS establishes a narrative of the world as one of repeated annihilation and overcoming.

As history speeds towards the present day and energy and resources diminish, what emerges is a hallucinogenic vision of a world on the brink of total collapse. This is contemporary Western society: people with the tools, intelligence and power to change the course of the planet, but who can't find the will.

Jump cutting between genres and underpinned by a gradually evolving live score, APOKALYPSIS is a high octane, searing indictment of denialism and our inability to work together in this extraordinary moment in time: the eve of the Anthropocene.
