This Dada-esque cabinet of curiosities includes over 700 violin artefacts, iconography, and improbable instruments; performances that are musically perverse, historically twisted, and culturally critical. Sourced from Australiaâ€™s most unusual collection, The Rosenberg Museum is the brainchild of violinist, composer, and artist Jon Rose. 

Experience these improbable instruments in action with performances on the 5th, 6th, 12th & 13th April with musicians Ernie Althof, Robbie Avenaim, Biddy Connor, Jozef Cseres, Judith Hamann, Rainer Linz, Michael McNab, Maria Moles, Chloe Smith, Hollis Taylor, Erkki Veltheim,Lizzy Welsh and Brigid Bourke. 

The Violin Generator is a free exhibition and performances are $10. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION, in conjunction with Tura New Music. Supported by Australia Council.
