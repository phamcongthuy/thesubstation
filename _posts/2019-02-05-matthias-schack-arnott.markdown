**Everywhen** by Matthias Schack-Arnott is a major new work exploring large-scale cyclic patterns. Up to 100 suspended percussive objects hover and rotate along a six-meter moving axis. The work investigates a perpetually shifting sonic environment through the intersection of sound, time and space. 

> Matthias Schack-Arnott is a Melbourne based percussive artist working in contemporary classical and experimental music as a performer, composer and
improviser.

> Described by The Guardian as ‘sonically and visually exquisite’, Matthias’ solo work explores unique approaches to percussive performance, often involving the development of new instrumental set-ups built in collaboration with architects, engineers and technicians. His work has been presented by Melbourne Festival, La Comete (France), The Unconformity (Tasmania), Arts House, Supersense – Festival of the Ecstatic (Arts Centre Melbourne), MPavilion, Spor Festival (Denmark), Spot Festival (Denmark) & Next Wave (2012 & 2014).
