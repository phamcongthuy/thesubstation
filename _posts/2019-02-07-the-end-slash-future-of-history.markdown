In an international system that has been dominated by western ideology, a fundamental flaw exists with the administering of rights.  It is a system where the guarantor of rights is almost always the key violator. This exhibition brings together a number of contemporary artists examining this very flaw within systems of Government. They call to question the ability of governments in fulfilling needs of people when presented with conflicting demands.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and HYPHENATED PROJECTS as part of DUE WEST FESTIVAL.
