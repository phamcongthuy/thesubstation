100 YEARS explores the diverse history, architecture and location of THE SUBSTATION building. 30 artists from across disciplines will be in residence over two weeks, taking over the entire gallery. Working with imagery, performance, documentation, sound and installation, the artists will respond to and interpret the site in celebration and recognition of our centennial.

## About the artists

[**THE COUNCIL OF SVOO**](https://rmitlink.rmit.edu.au/Clubs/Club.aspx?CID=154) is an open collective of artists responding to site in an architectural, historical, and socio-political context. Based out of RMIT Bachelor of Fine Art, part of their core methodology involves engaging with new and emerging artists, and building networks through site-responsive projects.
