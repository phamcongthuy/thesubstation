LADY EXAMPLE is a dance – of bodies, words, and women.

Created and performed by Alice Dixon, Caroline Meaden and William McBride, with an ensemble of artists, Lady Example undertakes a deranged and exquisite stocktake of our histories and mythologies to propose a litany of new, glorious, shuddering worlds. Combining contemporary dance, text and theatre, this tender and sly performance considers the historical and contemporary feminine – on our stages, on our screens, and in the performance of everyday life – looking at the lady examples that made us, and the lady examples we are making still.

Choreography: Alice Dixon, William McBride and Caroline Meaden
Performed by Fleur Conlon, Alice Dixon, Patrick Durnan Silva, Benjamin Hurley, William McBride, Caroline Meaden, Hannah Monson, Emma Riches and Joanne White <br>
Sound Design: Emah Fox <br>
Lighting Design: Jason Crick <br>
Set and Costume Design: Matilda Woodroofe <br>
Produced: Erin Milne <br>
