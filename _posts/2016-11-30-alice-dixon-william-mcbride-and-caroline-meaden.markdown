"_Women of the world take over, because if you don't the world will come to an end, and we haven't got long._" - Ivor Cutler and Linda Hirst.<br>
 <br>
LADY EXAMPLE is a literal, detailed examination of women in our lives, city, history, mythology and popular culture. Performers [ALICE DIXON, CAROLINE MEADEN](http://aliceandcaroline.com.au) and [WILLIAM MCBRIDE](http://oddbody.weebly.com/the-bodies.html) study these women in forensic detail, analysing and inhabiting their carriage, aura, speech and interactions, exploring hidden vulnerabilities and hierarchical power structures at play. In the development of this work, the performers will propose a multifaceted way of being ‘lady’; a ‘total woman’ – who will be able to guide us all forward.
