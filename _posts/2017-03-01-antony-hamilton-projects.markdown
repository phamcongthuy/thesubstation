Co-commissioned by France's La Comète Scène Nationale de Châlons en Champagne and The SUBSTATION, THEY WANT NEW LANGUAGE is a collaboration between choreographer, [ANTONY HAMILTON](http://antonyhamiltonprojects.com) and percussionist, [MATTHIAS SCHACK-ARNOTT](http://matthiasschackarnott.com). HAMILTON and SCHACK-ARNOTT will dissect the notion of ‘origin’, leaving their usual tools of production outside the studio, instead bringing only the knowledge located in their bodies.
