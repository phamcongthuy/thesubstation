Sparked off by one of the imaginary lands in ITALO CALVINO's novella Invisible Cities, [AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA](http://www.aao.com.au/)'s DIOMIRA is an expedition forging a path between the observable and the unreal.

Chamber jazz orchestra expands with the additions of turntables, reel-to-reel tape machines and live signal processing, while the sounds of acoustic instruments and voices are interwoven with vinyl-cut field recordings, toying with perceptions of what is heard and what has only been imagined. This layered sound world is further augmented by multiscreen projections as time folds into itself, leaving the residue of moments half-remembered.

Exploring the spaces between the avant-garde and the traditional, art and popular music since 1994, AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA is fired by the same spirit of restlessness that drove the earliest pioneers of jazz to produce music that defined the twentieth century.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [MELBOURNE FESTIVAL](https://www.festival.melbourne/).

Composer: Peter Knight
