[ROBIN FOX](http://robinfox.com.au/) will spend a week at THE SUBSTATION consolidating new RGB laser materials and methodologies. FOX will be designing new sections for realising the geometric connection between sound and image and exploring new ideas for installation works that take architecture and the human experience of space as starting points. The aim is to further refine his attempts to create a manufactured synaesthetic and sensorially ecstatic experience.
