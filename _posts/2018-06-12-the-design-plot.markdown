THE DESIGN PLOT is an ongoing performance project by [SHELLEY LASICA](www.shelleylasica.com) including collaborations with six dancers and a cinematographer. 

THE DESIGN PLOT uses the structure of dancing, with the discipline of scenography as a source for its design and development.

Responding to the context, this utterance of the project will take over The SUBSTATION, unfolding through a methodology that includes open research sessions, public talks, installation and the development of performance mechanisms.

Dancers: ELLEN DAVIES, TIMOTHY HARVEY, LOUELLA MAY HOGAN, DANIEL NEWELL, LILIAN STEINER AND JO WHITE <br>
Cinematographer: JAMES WRIGHT

The project has previously been presented at RMIT Design Hub, MPavilion, Gertrude Glasshouse, Minanoie, the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club and Sutton Projects.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [Open House Melbourne.](https://www.openhousemelbourne.org/)
