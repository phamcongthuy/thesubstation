REMAIN was made in collaboration with several of the men who still remain on Manus Island, PNG, five or more years after they left their homelands to seek asylum in Australia, but instead were sent to languish in the remote offshore detention centre. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and Hyphenated Projects.
