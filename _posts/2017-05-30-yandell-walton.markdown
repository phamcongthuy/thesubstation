[YANDELL WALTON](http://yandellw.tumblr.com/)â€™s work uses projection, installation and digital media to meld architectural space with projected images. Blurring the lines between the actual and the virtual, WALTON explores the relationship between nature and human mortality through environmental, political, personal and social
experiences.

Through this residency, WALTON will develop a series of new site-responsive works for The SUBSTATION. The installations investigate the interactions between human and machine, the organic and inorganic, and explore the fragile connections we have with each other and the world we live in.
