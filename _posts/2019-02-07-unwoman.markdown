THE RABBLE and Maeve Stone featuring Olwen Fouéré, Dana Miltins and Mary Helen Sassman.

Unwoman is a woman.
Unwoman is not a woman.
Unwoman is song.
Unwoman is a crime.
Unwoman is a real and substantial risk.

The SUBSTATION premieres UNWOMAN, an uncompromising piece of feminist theatre by THE RABBLE in collaboration with Irish artist Maeve Stone. UNWOMAN examines bodily autonomy and reproductive rights.
