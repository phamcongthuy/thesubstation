[CHARLEMAGNE PALESTINE](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/charlemagne-palestine-carillon-bells) is a critically acclaimed artist exploring the transcendent potentials of music. Working across questions of resonance and duration, [PALESTINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bulibjyaQ0s&t=1247s)’s works for piano, organ, carillon and voice are defining moments in the 20th and 21st Century, exploring states of trace realised through music.

His work with organ specifically has created some of the most harmonically rich and intense explorations for that instrument. PALESTINE will deliver a powerful performance for organ and voice on the historic organ of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Williamstown, working with the architecture of the space to explore harmony, overtones and the very resonance of music itself. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with [ROOM40](http://room40.org/).
