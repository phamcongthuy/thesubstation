Grayson has been in this carpark for ten thousand two hundred and sixty-one years. She’s been waiting for you. So she can show you the gaps. Between her world and yours.

[THIS IS GRAYSON](http://melbournefringe.com.au/event/this-is-grayson/) is the story of a little girl who lives between worlds. She wants to show you who she meets and what she sees. She wants you to know what it’s like to live in the in-between.

Not just for kids and not just for adults, THIS IS GRAYSON is for both to experience together. Gold Satino are making the show that they needed when they were young queers, awkward outsiders yearning for someone to see them.

You will meet a woman at The SUBSTATION. She will take you to a bus and you will go on an intimate, surreal and immersive journey through Newport’s forgotten lands.

Bring your sense of adventure and your curiosity, and let Grayson show you the things hiding in plain sight.

This project is supported by Melbourne Fringe, Hobsons Bay City Council and Australia Council for the Arts.
