One of the world’s most distinctive guitarists, [KIM MYHR](http://www.kimmyhr.com/)’s sound has been described as somewhere between American folk strumming and 60s avant-garde orchestral soundmass. For the first time in Australia, KIM MYHR performs redefining solo works for the 12 string guitar. 

MYHR has performed solo at some of the most significant festivals and venues in Europe, establishing his reputation as one of the instrument’s leading contemporary innovators. The WIRE called MYHR’s first release, ALL YOUR LIMBS SINGING (SOFA) as "a delirious love letter to the 12-string guitar.” And in 2016, MYHR released a collaborative album with JENNY HVAL and TRONDHEIM JAZZ ORCHESTRA, “IN THE END HIS VOICE WILL BE THE SOUND OF PAPER” which was described as “…a grotesquely beautiful paradox of sound, pleasing to the last.” – Slug Magazine.

MYHR will be joined by trail-blazing trumpeter and sound artist, PETER KNIGHT with a performance of ALLOTROPE. 

ALLOTROPE, that is, the varying atomic states of a physical form (Carbon; Graphite, Diamond) is KNIGHT’s solo piece created using trumpet, laptop electronics, amplifier and pedals. ALLOTROPE explores KNIGHT’s multidisciplinary preoccupation with space, understatement and long form structure, which draws inspiration from a diverse range of sources.

[PETER KNIGHT](http://peterknightmusic.com/), who has been described as, “Hard to categorise… hauntingly memorable” (The Wire, UK) has toured as a solo artist to major festivals and venues around the world,

“If trumpet is an element, then Knight is an alchemist” – New York City Jazz Record.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and the [MELBOURNE INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL](http://melbournejazz.com/).
