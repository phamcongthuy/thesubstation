A highly regarded verbatim play by the late VICKI REYNOLDS, THE BRIDGE will be presented within a multi-media installation featuring video projection and design by BINDI COLE CHOCKA and music by JAMES HENRY. Directed by DONNA JACKSON and performed by an ensemble cast of actors and community members, THE BRIDGE revisits the collapse of a giant span of Melbourneâ€™s Westgate Bridge in 1970 that claimed the lives of thirty-five workers. 

This powerful installation and theatrical collaboration consider the historical impact and current ramifications of this event through the lens of past and present politics. The West Gate Bridge is more than a physical bridge; it is a link to the past, family and friends, between different cultures and into the future.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and The ART & INDUSTRY FESTIVAL.  

Supported by Hobsons Bay City Council, Hubcap Productions and the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its arts funding advisory body.
