Visceral and intimate, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) journeys toward a collective understanding of rhythm and sound in the belly of the SUBSTATION.

Performances from: <br>
BEE MASK presents MARBLES - Live ( USA ) <br>
AGONIS - Live/hybrid ( CH ) <br>
SIMON LEMONT - Live/hybrid ( CH ) <br>
ALBRECHT LA'BROOY - Live ( AUS ) <br>

Room, artists and audience—all form part of the storyline.

The night will feature American experimentalist BEE MASK [live], Swiss electronic producer AGONIS, Swiss DJ SIMON LEMONT and Melbourne’s own ALBRECHT LA'BROOY [live].

As narratives unfold, the response is both sonic and social. Part music performance, part installation—ONO presents an evening of international and local guests exploring the undercurrents of music today. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and ONO.
