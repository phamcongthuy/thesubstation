ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019 festival artist Yandell Walton invites visitors to The SUBSTATION to experience her immersive, digital installation Shifting Surrounds. This major exhibition of site-specific installations was developed by the artist through a series of on-site residencies in 2017/18 and the resulting work responds to the unique architecture of the building to interrogate the shifting environments caused by climate change. 

ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019 is a socially-engaged festival of climate change related arts and ideas featuring curated exhibitions and theatre works alongside a series of keynote lectures, events and public forums featuring local and international guests.

Presented by The SUBSTATION, [CLIMARTE](www.artclimatechange.org) and [Centre for Projection Art](https://www.centreforprojectionart.com.au/). This project has been assisted by the Australian Government through the Australia Council for the Arts, its arts funding and advisory body.
