## **“A TRIP DEEP WITHIN THE MOTHERSHIP – HYPNOTIC AND BEAUTIFULLY DISORIENTATING” – The Wire magazine**

> **[William Basinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcHdxTj00I)** is a classically trained musician and composer who has been working in experimental media for over 30 years in NYC and most recently, California. Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time.

> **[Caterina Barbieri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aH1HGzCUc)** is an Italian composer now based in Berlin. Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. By means of synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology.
