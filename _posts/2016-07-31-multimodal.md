Director and choreographer LEE SERLE melds audience and artist in the interactive, immersive and participatory performance piece MULTIMODAL, occupying THE SUBSTATION from August 30 - September 4.

MULTIMODAL guides randomly selected audience members through a series of physical, sonic, olfactory and choreographic experiences housed within The SUBSTATION’s various post-industrial spaces.

Those selected, contribute to the work’s unfolding content as they journey through BYRON SCULLIN's visceral sonic experiences, physical movement spaces and immersive, scent laden installations from visual artist LIZ HENDERSON and LEE SERLE **,** eliciting memories and personal narratives throughout the performance ritual.

Performers DEANNE BUTTERWORTH, BENJAMIN HANCOCK, GEOFFREY WATSON and REBECCA JENSEN, together with eight guides, lead the inductees through the installation series - blurring the lines between performer and audience, and public and private space, as the ritual’s voyeurs (the audience) observe their performance induction from afar.

**BYRON SCULLIN.** The work of Melbourne practitioner [BYRON SCULLIN](http://www.byronscullin.com/) explores the technological representation and amplification of sound as well as its properties as a physical presence. Operating in an ambiguous space where sound transitions into noise, SCULLIN's sonic environments offer an experience of mass and multiplicity, often representing attempts to hear the unhearable.

After an interest in synthesis at a young age, SCULLIN was mentored by producer and composer Francois Tetaz. He has since been involved in almost all aspects of audio in his twenty year career, contributing sound to feature films such as Wolf Creek, contemporary dance productions by Lucy Guerin, Gideon Obarzanek, and Lee Serle, and theatre works by David Chisholm, Chamber Made Opera, and Arena Theatre Co. He also works as a sound educator at RMIT and Melbourne University. A prolific collaborator, SCULLIN has worked closely with audio-visual artist Robin Fox and video artist Daniel Crooks, as well as Australian composers Anthony Pateras, Marco Fusinato, and Oren Ambarchi. He’s also helped realise sound for notable international artists including Bernard Parmegiani, Tony Conrad, and Steven O’Malley.
