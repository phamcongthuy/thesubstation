CAIN AND ABEL is an electrifying theatrical experience, a provocative and bloody retelling of a story that has stained the earth and our psyche for millennia.

The biblical story of [CAIN AND ABEL](http://therabble.com.au/cain-abel/) is the tale of the first act of violence – an act that ricocheted across time. It envisions our history as man on man, brother on brother, blood on the earth. Well beyond its religious beginnings, it is a story that has defined our contemporary understanding of violence. [THE RABBLE](http://therabble.com.au/) has reimagined the story as a female one, with two sisters at the centre of the work (MARY HELEN SASSMAN and DANA MILTINS). The sisters recreate the first act of violence over and over again – from biblical sanctity to the spectacle of Hollywood. This is THE RABBLE at their best: a brave, iconoclastic and visually arresting work that questions our core assumptions about femininity and violence.

## Tues July 26: Artists Post-Show Talk
A History of Violence? EMMA VALENTE with REBECCA FORGASZ and hosted by ADENA JACOBS.
