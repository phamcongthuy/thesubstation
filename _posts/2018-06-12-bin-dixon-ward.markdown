[BIN DIXON-WARD](bin.dixon-ward.com)'s work uses 3D printing to explore the links between the geometry of urban and industrial infrastructure across the West through contemporary jewellery. 

With Melbourne’s sparkling CBD towers in the rearview mirror, the West Gate freeway is an artery through rapidly changing industrial and suburban landscapes. ‘This is what’s left of the West Gate’ examines the region by drawing upon satellite images to reveal a not just a landscape featuring the massive infrastructure of industrial and manufacturing industries but coastal wetlands, housing, parklands and sports fields, shipping and cleared ‘ghost sites’, evidence of past industrial histories, all laid out along a lacelike network of creeks, roads and railways. 

BIN DIXON-WARD’s jewellery reflects the impact of the changing role of the western suburbs using technologies of the ‘next industrial age’. Using the same tools that are used to design cities, and buildings to design jewellery but on a micro scale.
