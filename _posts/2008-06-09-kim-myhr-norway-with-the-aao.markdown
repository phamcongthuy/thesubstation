Leading light on the Norwegian experimental scene, [KIM MYHR](http://www.kimmyhr.com/), performs in the world premiere of a new piece created especially for the shape-shifting 10-piece, the [AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA](http://www.aao.com.au/). Tailored to the groupâ€™s ability to traverse acoustic and electronic textures, MYHR weaves a complex interplay of rhythmic pulses, visceral texture and near psychedelic harmonic density.
