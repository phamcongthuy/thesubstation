PUSHED explores the poetics of amplification, embodiment and sensory perception. Driven by dance artist [PAEA LEACH](http://www.paealeach.com), the work is borne from interests in attention and how we physically experience the environments we live in. Utilising body, sound and light, each form pushes towards a gradual crescendo. PUSHED will be made specifically for and within the belly of The SUBSTATION. 

Sound artists: Madeleine Flynn and Tim Humphrey<br>
Light/space design artist: Ben Bosco Shaw<br>
Performers/dancers: Caroline Meaden, Gregory Lorenzutti
