CHARLES PURCELL and ZAK PIDD are theatre-makers and actors based in Melbourne whose distinct skill sets are fundamental to their combined practice. PURCELL’s background in writing, cultural studies and dramaturgy is blended with PIDD’s experience as a multi-instrumentalist, whose exploration of sound underpins all of the work he makes.

Together they will develop a new performance work through their shared collaborative devising process. Each of their collaborations to date have been driven by alternative dramaturgies, collages of disparate, multi-modal theatrical languages, and an investigation into the relationship between chaos and structure in performance.

Commissioned by [NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL](http://nextwave.org.au/) through their KICKSTART HELIX PROGRAM.
