Based an hour north of Glasgow, COVE PARK offers artist residencies that respond to the diversity of contemporary artistic practice of all art forms. In 2018, COVE PARK will host Australian sound artist, THEMBI SODDELL.

[THEMBI SODDELL](http://thembisoddell.com/) (b. Australia 1980) is am electroacoustic composer, sound artist and practice-based researcher with an interest in psychology, perception, extreme emotion and the subjectivity of experience. She works primarily with the sampler, generating sounds from field recordings, instrument textures, played found objects and synthesis to form surreal and ambiguous realisations of place and experience. These volatile, filmic sound worlds often exploit the dynamic extremes, toying with a listener's sense of expectation and disquiet.

A partnership between The SUBSTATION and [CRYPTIC](http://www.cryptic.org.uk/).
