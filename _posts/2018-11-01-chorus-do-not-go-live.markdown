# A darkly humorous look at the social function of gossip.


Performance artist Melanie Jame Wolfe’s video and sound installation CHORUS explores Greek mythology through a high camp lens. Drawing its title from the group of performers in Greek theatre whose role it is to comment on the action, Wolfe’s artwork takes a darkly humorous look at the social function of gossip. 


> **[Melanie Jame Wolf](https://www.savage-amusement.com/about-savage-amusement)** is an Australian born artist who lives and works between Melbourne and Berlin. She makes work about economies. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Always exploring systems of value and exchange, particularly as they occur in the murky field of immaterial capital – the social, the cultural, the affective. She investigates these flows as they are produced through ideas of ghosts, of gender, of pop, of myth, of morality, of sensuality, of class.
