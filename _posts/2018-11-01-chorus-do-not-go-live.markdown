## **A darkly humorous look at the social function of gossip.** 

Performance artist Melanie Jame Wolfe’s video and sound installation Chorus explores Greek mythology through a high camp lens. Drawing its title from the group of performers in Greek theatre whose role it is to comment on the action, Wolfe’s artwork takes a darkly humorous look at the social function of gossip.
