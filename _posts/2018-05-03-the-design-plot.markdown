THE DESIGN PLOT is an ongoing performance project by [SHELLEY LASICA](http://shelleylasica.com/) including collaborations with six dancers and a cinematographer.

THE DESIGN PLOT uses the structure of dancing, with the discipline of scenography as a source for its design and development. Responding to the context, this utterance of the project will take over The SUBSTATION, unfolding through a methodology that includes open research sessions, public talks, installation and the development of performance mechanisms.

As part of this suite, and for [Open House Melbourne.](https://www.openhousemelbourne.org/), GREATER UNION is a new duet work for Lasica and Timothy Harvey with whom she has worked with over fifteen years. The duet considers the unstable specificity of particular project and the notion of the archive, or the organism of ‘the body work’. 

Shelley Lasica will also be in conversation with an independent writer, curator, and a part-time academic in the School of Architecture and Design at RMIT Phip Murray, discussing her own choreographic history in relation to collaboration and documentation.

Dancers: ELLEN DAVIES, TIMOTHY HARVEY, LOUELLA MAY HOGAN, DANIEL NEWELL, LILIAN STEINER AND JO WHITE <br>
Cinematographer: JAMES WRIGHT

The project has previously been presented at RMIT Design Hub, MPavilion, Gertrude Glasshouse, Minanoie, the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club and Sutton Projects.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [Open House Melbourne.](https://www.openhousemelbourne.org/)
