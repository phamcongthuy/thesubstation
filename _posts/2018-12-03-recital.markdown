Dancer. Percussionist. Rivals. A strange and mesmeric double act.

Three-time APRA Art Music Award-winning percussionist Claire Edwardes and Helpmann Award-winning dancer Richard Cilli unite their distinct virtuosic talents in an unusual presentation of how movement sounds, and how sound moves.

From formal beginnings into virtuosic performance and competitive play, Edwardes and Cilli collaborate with acclaimed director and choreographer Gideon Obarzanek and Australia’s leading electro-pop composer Paul Mac to create an intriguing display. 

Set in the orthodox world of a music and dance recital, the ambiguous relationship between the two performers intensifies. The outcomes are impressive, disturbing and wildly ecstatic.

Director: Gideon Obarzanek <br>
Performers: Richard Cilli, Claire Edwardes <br>
Lighting Design: Bosco Shaw <br>
Composition & Sound Design: Paul Mac, Claire Edwardes <br>
Producer: Erin Milne (Bureau Of Works) <br>
