Children all around Australia learn to bush dance every year. You did, I did, we all did. So what’s the deal with a bush dance? What does it mean today? And will we still be Krumping in a hundred years’ time? Take your partner by the hand as [ST MARTINS](https://stmartinsyouth.com.au/) throws the rule book away. Kids call the shots in this riotous night of dance, banter and iced vovos. This is not your average bush dance, this is a contemporary reimagining through the lens of ST MARTINS’ young artists.
