## A DARKLY HUMOROUS LOOK AT THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF GOSSIP. <br>

CHORUS explores Greek mythology through an immersive multiscreen and sound installation. Drawing its title from the group of performers in Greek theatre whose role it is to comment on the action, this darkly humorous work invites visitors to think about the role of gossip in culture. 

In the videos performance artist Melanie Jame Wolf’s inhabits a series of electrifying personas from ancient Greek mythology. These female deities – representing virtues and ideas ranging from love, beauty, wisdom to chaos – are inhabited by the artist with camp abandon.
 
Using overlapping speech and sound and theatrical visual techniques to create a cacophonous soundscape, CHORUS embraces flamboyance, theatricality and a joyfully pop sensibility while exploring serious questions about Western civilisation. How do we interpret and report on human behaviour? In what way do our voices – in unison – enforce cultural attitudes? How does gossip enforce notions of properness and shame? 


> **[Melanie Jame Wolf](https://www.savage-amusement.com/about-savage-amusement)** is an Australian born artist who lives and works between Melbourne and Berlin. She makes work about economies. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Always exploring systems of value and exchange, particularly as they occur in the murky field of immaterial capital – the social, the cultural, the affective. She investigates these flows as they are produced through ideas of ghosts, of gender, of pop, of myth, of morality, of sensuality, of class.
