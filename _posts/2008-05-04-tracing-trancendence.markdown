A meditation on the distance between deserts and the worn tracks on the road to prayer — TRACING TRANSCENDENCE treads a path towards encountering the spiritual and sacred, ritual and remote.

[SHIREEN TAWEEL](http://shireentaweel.com/) is an artist based at the Parramatta Artist Studios. Her creative practice continues a long tradition that involves the act of marking and piercing copper. This process stretches throughout history and across cultures, but is intimately connected to TAWEEL’s contemporary experience of being a migrant of Muslim and Lebanese heritage living in Australia.

The gestures that TAWEEL marks into copper are suggestive of an art form steeped in tradition, but are explored through new perspectives, placing emphasis on the global experience of migration, movement and multiculturalism. The resulting works contribute to a cross-cultural discourse of shared histories and experiences between diverse communities and cultural groups.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [NEXT WAVE](http://nextwave.org.au/) as part of the KICKSTART HELIX PROGRAM.
