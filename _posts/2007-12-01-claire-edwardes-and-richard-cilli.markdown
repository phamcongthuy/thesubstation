Described as the ‘sorceress of percussion’, celebrated Sydney-based percussionist [CLAIRE EDWARDES](http://www.claireedwardes.com/) unites with Helpmann award-winning dancer and choreographer RICHARD CILLI in a new physically virtuosic work.

Directed by acclaimed choreographer GIDEON OBARZANEK, two very different artists collide as they are pitted against one another, taking an abrasive look at the things that divide and unite us. Touching on themes including gender, sexuality, psychology and age, EDWARDES and CILLI will take aim at our desire to connect despite our differences.
