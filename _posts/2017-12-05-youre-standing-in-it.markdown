Resident Artist AMANDA CARR explores the relationship between the observer and environment through an unlikely symbiosis of theatrical staging and liquid mechanics on The SUBSTATION billboards.

In the work, YOU’RE STANDING IN IT, [AMANDA CARR](http://amandacarrcreative.com/) forces fluids into a microscopic void between parallel planes to observe the instability produced by differing surface tensions. This phenomenon, known as Hele-Shaw flow, produces a visual landscape that is as foreign as it is familiar, imaginary in appearance yet undeniably natural.

CARR’s artistic practice transfers the image onto fabric to craft wearable designs, distorting scale and distinction between background and foreground. The human illusion of autonomy enveloped in a volatile terrain forged through a collision of opposing forces.

Where does the body end and the environment begin? Do we create each other? Or destroy one another?
