Visceral and intimate, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) journeys toward a collective understanding of rhythm and sound in the belly of the SUBSTATION.

Room, artists and audience—all form part of the storyline. 

As narratives unfold, the response is both sonic and social. Part music performance, part installation—ONO presents an evening of international and local guests exploring the undercurrents of music today. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and ONO.
