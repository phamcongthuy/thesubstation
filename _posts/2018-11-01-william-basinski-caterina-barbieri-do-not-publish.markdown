> **[William Basinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcHdxTj00I)** is a classically trained musician and composer who has been working in experimental media for over 30 years in NYC and most recently, California. Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time. Installations and films made in collaboration with artist-filmmaker, James Elaine have been presented in festivals and museums internationally, and his concerts are presented to sold out crowds around the world. Most recently, Basinski was chosen by Music Director, Antony Hegarty to create music for the new Robert Wilson opera, The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic which had its world premiere at the Manchester International Festival in July 2011 and toured Europe in 2012 and North America in 2013. Orchestral transcriptions of The Disintegration Loops by Maxim Moston have been performed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Queen Elizabeth Hall and will tour Europe with various orchestras.

> **[Caterina Barbieri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aH1HGzCUc)** is an Italian composer now based in Berlin. Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. A focus
> on minimalism in composition arises from a meditation on primary waveforms and exploration of the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers. By means of
> synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology. She has performed major shows at festivals including Berlin Atonal, Berliner Festspiele’s Maerzmusik, Norbergfestival as well as compositions for theatre and multimedia presentations and releases on
Important Records. The Wire magazine has described her music as “a trip deep within the mothership – hypnotic and beautifully disorientating”.
