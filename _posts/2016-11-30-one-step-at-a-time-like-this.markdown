NOIR TRAIL is an immersive performance event taking place over consecutive days in multiple urban locations.

The work is conceived as a mini-series, exploring mystery, the unknown, and the nature of fear. Audience members are directed to precincts such as abandoned halls, bars, rail yards, pool halls and unused public spaces where actions, cues and revelations happen. 

The audience must actively engage with each environment in order to uncover the next piece in the puzzle. The work interweaves performance, audience conversation, live radio, walking, sound and video installation. As the audience move, they journey further into questions surrounding the perception of fear and what generates it.
