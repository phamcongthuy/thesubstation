Naarm-based sustainable fashion label REMUSE launches its biannual Equinox clothing collection and second mycology inspired release, ‘Micología II’ in a multisensory and immersive runway experience. MICOLOGÍA elaborates on the cosmic origins of the kingdom of funghi, exploring themes of synchronicity with nature, symbiosis and biomimicry and sustainability through theatrical dialogue and visual display. This is a singularly imaginative fashion runway performance.
