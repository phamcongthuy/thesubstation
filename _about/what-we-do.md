The SUBSTATION is a not-for-profit multi arts centre located in a 100-year-old repurposed, industrial building.

The SUBSTATION presents an annual curated program of creative development, residencies and presentation. Engaging with artists from across artistic disciplines, working in non-traditional modes and across art-forms, The SUBSTATION provides the opportunity for artists and audiences to connect with our unique space and the distinctive location of Newport.

Reflecting the broader history of Melbourneâ€™s inner west, we encourage artists to engage with our post-industrial space where we foster a culture of interconnectedness, collaboration and independence, and where we value new ideas, imagination and difference.
