PIECES is Lucy Guerin Inc’s new annual performance program to support the work of emerging and independent Victorian choreographers. A re-invention of LGI’s much-loved series Pieces for Small Spaces, PIECES introduces an exciting collaboration with The SUBSTATION.
 
This new project coincides with the company’s ambitious move to WXYZ Studios which opens up possibilities for more in-depth, sustained working periods for artists. Three choreographers will have the opportunity to create works of 20-30 minutes during a four-week development period at the LGI studios, with a final presentation season to take place at The SUBSTATION.
 
PIECES will provide space for artists to challenge their regular practice and execute their most daring ideas; and with the collaborative support of two bold arts organisations, shift our existing notions of dance.
