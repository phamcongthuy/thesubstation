tagline: Video art that explores forces of fluidity and resistance.

Channels Festival 2019 brings together Australian and international artists who use video art practices to challenge our understanding of difference, distribution, power and place. The festival explores forces of fluidity and resistance, blurs fact with fiction, plays with time, and deconstruct notions of belonging and complicity.
