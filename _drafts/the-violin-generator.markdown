This Dada-esque cabinet of curiosities includes over 700 violin artefacts, iconography, and improbable instruments; performances that are musically perverse, historically twisted, and culturally critical. Sourced from Australiaâ€™s most unusual collection, The Rosenberg Museum is the brainchild of violinist, composer, and artist Jon Rose.
