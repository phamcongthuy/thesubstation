Join Claire Edwardes and Richard Cilli in their ritual of performance, as they connect in a darkly comedic display where music and dance merge as one.

What first appears as a formal recital combining dance and music, their partnership soon reveals a more complex and disturbing shadow of difference and rivalry. Consigned to perform in parallel isolation, Claire and Richard’s solos come together to create a larger mesmeric experience.
