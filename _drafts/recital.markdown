Three-time APRA Art Music Award-winning percussionist Claire Edwardes and Helpmann Award-winning contemporary dancer Richard Cilli unite their distinct virtuosic talents to create a unique double-act, directed by acclaimed director and choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.

What first appears as a formal recital combining dance and music, their partnership soon reveals a more complex and disturbing shadow of difference and rivalry. Consigned to perform in parallel isolation, Claire and Richardâ€™s solos come together to create a larger mesmeric experience.

Join Claire and Richard in their ritual of performance, as they connect in a darkly comedic display where music and dance merge as one.

Director: Gideon Obarzanek
