For the past four decades, Japan’s MERZBOW has reigned supreme as the undisputed king of noise. With hundreds of releases to his credit, MERZBOW has created a sonic macrocosm which has inspired generations of artists. Live, MERZBOW’s sonic works are all-consuming; he creates a uniquely physical sound world within which the bodies of his audience are entirely consumed. To describe it as a wall of noise is to understate the experience, MERZBOW’s performances generate a universe of noise, infinitely deep, infinitely complex and one that produces profound overstimulation across all spectra of experience, resulting in a euphoria unlike anything else you might hope to experience. He is joined by the formidable composer and low-frequency cultivator CAT HOPE.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and ROOM40.
