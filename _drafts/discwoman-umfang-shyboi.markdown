Cool Room is a collective and event series focused on changing conversations around representation and safety in electronic music, while creating a safer space for marginalised peoples to dance. Past guests have included Steffi, Terre Thaemlitz (AKA DJ Sprinkles), Laurel Halo, and K-HAND. 

Founded by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, Emma Burgess-Olson and Christine McCharen-Tran, Discwoman is a New York-based platform, collective, and booking agency—that showcases and represents talent in electronic music. Started as a two-day festival in September 2014 at Bossa Nova Civic Club Discwoman has since produced and curated events in 20+ cities—working with over 300 DJs and producers globally to-date.

The collective makes their Australian debut with SHYBOI and co-founders Umfang (Emma Burgess-Olson), Christine McCharen-Tran, and Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson. Expect a night of unfiltered, raw, politically-charged techno and beyond.
