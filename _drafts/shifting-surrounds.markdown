Shifting Surrounds is a major exhibition of immersive installations by Yandell Walton for ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019. Shifting Surrounds explores human relationships with ecological and physical systems of the planet, by interrogating shifting environments caused by climate change. Each site-responsive work has been developed through a series of residencies at The SUBSTATION over 2017 and 2018. By incorporating digital technology in the production and presentation of the works Yandell aims to highlight the current technological climate and raise questions around its effect on our rapidly changing world.

ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019 is a socially-engaged festival of climate change related arts and ideas featuring curated exhibitions and theatre works alongside a series of keynote lectures, events and public forums featuring local and international guests.
