Maeve Stone and THE RABBLE feat. Olwen Fouéré, Dana Miltins and Mary Helen Sassman 

Unwoman is a woman.
Unwoman is not a woman.
Unwoman is song.
Unwoman is a crime.
Unwoman is a real and substantial risk.

UNWOMAN is an epic imagistic uncompromising piece of feminist theatre created in both Ireland and Australia, examining reproductive rights and control of the female body.  

UNWOMAN is presented by THE RABBLE and The SUBSTATION. This project has been supported by the Victorian Government through Creative Victoria, and the Australian Government through the Australia Council for the Arts. Unwoman Part III (2018) was created with commissioning support from Dublin Fringe Festival, developed through FRINGE LAB and produced with support from Pan Pan Theatre (Ireland).
