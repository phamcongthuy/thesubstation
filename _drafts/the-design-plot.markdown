THE DESIGN PLOT is an ongoing performance project by [SHELLEY LASICA](www.shelleylasica.com) including collaborations with six dancers and a cinematographer. 

THE DESIGN PLOT uses the structure of dancing, with the discipline of scenography as a source for its design and development.

Responding to the context, this utterance of the project will take over The SUBSTATION, unfolding through a methodology that includes open research sessions, public talks, installation and the development of performance mechanisms.

Dancers: ELLEN DAVIES, TIMOTHY HARVEY, LOUELLA MAY HOGAN, DANIEL NEWELL, LILIAN STEINER AND JO WHITE <br>
Cinematographer: JAMES WRIGHT

The project has previously been presented at RMIT Design Hub, MPavilion, Gertrude Glasshouse, Minanoie, the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club and Sutton Projects.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and Open House Melbourne.
