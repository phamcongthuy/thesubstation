&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/charlemagne-palestine-carillon-bells&quot;&gt;CHARLEMAGNE PALESTINE&lt;/a&gt; is a critically acclaimed artist exploring the transcendent potentials of music. Working across questions of resonance and duration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bulibjyaQ0s&amp;amp;t=1247s&quot;&gt;PALESTINE&lt;/a&gt;’s works for piano, organ, carillon and voice are defining moments in the 20th and 21st Century, exploring states of trace realised through music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work with organ specifically has created some of the most harmonically rich and intense explorations for that instrument. PALESTINE will deliver a powerful performance for organ and voice on the historic organ of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Williamstown, working with the architecture of the space to explore harmony, overtones and the very resonance of music itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Myhr’s solo performances are hypnotic. At once virtuosic and gestural, the sound world slowly unfolds as harmonics are gradually shifted through minute changes to a continuous strumming pattern. His performances have been described as “an orchestral exploration of the 12-string guitar sounding like something in between American folk strumming and 60s avant-garde soundness orchestral music.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phFRdRN-H1A&quot;&gt;LISTEN

&lt;p&gt;Tony Buck is one of the most extraordinary musicians Australia has produced. Based in Berlin for over two decades he has made his fame with iconic group, The Necks, which was recently called “the greatest trio on earth” by the New York Times. This concert will present a very rare solo performance by Tony Buck, who has been developing a performance mode that involves drum kit and electric guitar. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW6d6DnWiJ0&quot;&gt;WATCH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the world premiere live performance of a new piece Peter Knight has created for processed trumpet. Solo for Trumpet, Delays, Tape Loops, and Rice, showcases Peter’s unique approach to the instrument which uses laptop computer, Revox reel-to-reel tape, dropping rice, and multiple speakers to create an immersive experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WStrnakAJIE&quot;&gt;WATCH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created and performed by Alice Dixon, Caroline Meaden and William McBride, with an ensemble of artists, Lady Example undertakes a deranged and exquisite stocktake of our histories and mythologies to propose a litany of new, glorious, shuddering worlds. Combining contemporary dance, text and theatre, this tender and sly performance considers the historical and contemporary feminine – on our stages, on our screens, and in the performance of everyday life – looking at the lady examples that made us, and the lady examples we are making still.&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by remote Australian landscapes and Islamic decorative arts, Taweel’s approach is rooted in cross-cultural dialogue and consideration of sacred and secular spaces. The resulting work is a delicate and meditative intersection of past, present and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the work, YOU’RE STANDING IN IT, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandacarrcreative.com/&quot;&gt;AMANDA CARR&lt;/a&gt; forces fluids into a microscopic void between parallel planes to observe the instability produced by differing surface tensions. This phenomenon, known as Hele-Shaw flow, produces a visual landscape that is as foreign as it is familiar, imaginary in appearance yet undeniably natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARR’s artistic practice transfers the image onto fabric to craft wearable designs, distorting scale and distinction between background and foreground. The human illusion of autonomy enveloped in a volatile terrain forged through a collision of opposing forces.&lt;/p&gt;
