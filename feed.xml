This work asks: How do we forge a sonic template for queerness? How might non-masc bodies move in that space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Winter Witches is a collaborative performance project led by Jason Sweeney and Em König. Our collaborators include Jennifer Greer-Holmes, Kerrin Rowlands, Geoff Cobham and Sophie Osborne. We hail from Adelaide (Kaurna Yerta). Beginning in 2015 as a performance art DJ duo, Winter Witches has evolved into a cross-artform music and performance project, focusing on the creation of evocative and immersive sound and song-based live works. We are currently working on a trio of works (Sentients, MASC &amp;amp; Nature) that respond to the links between climate change, ideas of queer masculinities and visions of a queer ecological future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Matthias Schack-Arnott is a Melbourne based percussive artist working in contemporary classical and experimental music as a performer, composer and
improviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Described by The Guardian as ‘sonically and visually exquisite’, Matthias’ solo work explores unique approaches to percussive performance, often involving the development of new instrumental set-ups built in collaboration with architects, engineers and technicians. His work has been presented by Melbourne Festival, La Comete (France), The Unconformity (Tasmania), Arts House, Supersense – Festival of the Ecstatic (Arts Centre Melbourne), MPavilion, Spor Festival (Denmark), Spot Festival (Denmark) &amp;amp; Next Wave (2012 &amp;amp; 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through masterful movement and evocative sonic landscapes performed by dancer &lt;strong&gt;Lilian Steiner&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Reuben Lewis&lt;/strong&gt; on trumpet, Steiner utilises sound, language, colour and bodies in motion to lead audiences through memories of war and destruction, personal power, passion and human empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powerful and intense, &lt;strong&gt;Memoir for Rivers and the Dictator&lt;/strong&gt; captures the dramatic scope of historical events and shifting subject positions – from the individual to the collective – with a compelling dynamism. The piece engages the body as archival document: absorbing wisdom, values and events, as well as being the key resource for connecting with and responding to the activities of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally commissioned as part of the Keir Choreographic Award 2018, this is the world premiere of the full-length iteration of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

The work explores states of transition and the synergy between light, sound and the body, offering audiences a meditation on time, perspective and the moment of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed through in-depth collaboration and a residency at the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Centre (EMPAC) in New York, Rachel Arianne Ogle, Luke Smiles and Benjamin Cisterne have created a transcendental experiment in design. In the performance an external feed of radio communications and cosmic chatter manipulates both light and sound in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night is a choreography of perception. The audience witness a body in liminal space distorted by the media that surrounds it, becoming mesmerised by the hypnotic sensory experience of contemplation and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

Percussionist. Rivals. A strange and mesmeric double act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three-time APRA Art Music Award-winning percussionist Claire Edwardes and Helpmann Award-winning dancer Richard Cilli unite their distinct virtuosic talents in an unusual presentation of how movement sounds, and how sound moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From formal beginnings into virtuosic performance and competitive play, Edwardes and Cilli collaborate with acclaimed director and choreographer Gideon Obarzanek and Australia’s leading electro-pop composer Paul Mac to create an intriguing display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the orthodox world of a music and dance recital, the ambiguous relationship between the two performers intensifies. The outcomes are impressive, disturbing and wildly ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a shapeshifting chorus of camp figures, Wolf critically engages with the pleasures and dangers of vanity, ambition, greed, morality, chaos and mischief. Through surreal visuals and magnetic soundscape, CHORUS offers visitors an opportunity to reckon with the power associated with voice, both individual and in unison – our own and others – as we observe, interpret and report on human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does gossip enforce notions of what is proper and what is shameful?&lt;/p&gt;

She makes work about economies. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Always exploring systems of value and exchange, particularly as they occur in the murky field of immaterial capital – the social, the cultural, the affective. She investigates these flows as they are produced through ideas of ghosts, of gender, of pop, of myth, of morality, of sensuality, of class.&lt;/p&gt;

Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time.&lt;/p&gt;

Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. By means of synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
