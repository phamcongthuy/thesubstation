A prolific creator – he has released hundreds of recordings in a range of musical styles – he has collaborated with musicians from around the globe in a rich and varied career characterised by inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live, &lt;strong&gt;Merzbow’s&lt;/strong&gt; sonic works are all consuming; he creates a uniquely physical sound world within which the bodies of his audience are entirely consumed. To describe it as a wall of noise is to understate the experience, &lt;strong&gt;Merzbow’s&lt;/strong&gt; performances generate a universe of noise, infinitely deep, infinitely complex and one that produces profound overstimulation across all spectra of experience, resulting in a euphoria unlike anything else you might hope to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At The SUBSTATION he is joined by the formidable composer and low frequency cultivator &lt;strong&gt;Cat Hope&lt;/strong&gt;, a Perth-based noise, installation and performance artist and founding member of noise duo Lux Mammoth.&lt;/p&gt;
