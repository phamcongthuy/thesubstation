&lt;p&gt;With Melbourne’s sparkling CBD towers in the rearview mirror, the West Gate freeway is an artery through rapidly changing industrial and suburban landscapes. ‘This is what’s left of the West Gate’ examines the region by drawing upon satellite images to reveal a not just a landscape featuring the massive infrastructure of industrial and manufacturing industries but coastal wetlands, housing, parklands and sports fields, shipping and cleared ‘ghost sites’, evidence of past industrial histories, all laid out along a lacelike network of creeks, roads and railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIN DIXON-WARD’s jewellery reflects the impact of the changing role of the western suburbs using technologies of the ‘next industrial age’. Using the same tools that are used to design cities, and buildings to design jewellery but on a micro scale.&lt;/p&gt;

Directed by DONNA JACKSON and performed by an ensemble cast of actors and community members, THE BRIDGE revisits the collapse of a giant span of Melbourne’s Westgate Bridge in 1970 that claimed the lives of thirty-five workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This powerful installation and theatrical collaboration consider the historical impact and current ramifications of this event through the lens of past and present politics. The West Gate Bridge is more than a physical bridge; it is a link to the past, family and friends, between different cultures and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first art museums were spaces of conquest when they weren’t showcasing items pillaged from Non European cultures, it was the very bodies of those people put on display. Taungurung visual artist STEVEN RHALL dismantles the gallery as imperial machine, calling into question the very idea of Aboriginal Art as a classification in a series of installations which interrogate various contexts surrounding First Nation art practice and, it’s presentation for a public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located at the flashpoints of the European art canon and First Nations art practice, RHALL’s work roams across forms – performance, video, text and photography – and in recent years his playful and thought-provoking creations have been seen in the National Gallery of Victoria, ACCA and the Centre for Contemporary Photography. DEFUNCTIONALISED AUTONOMOUS OBJECTS is RHALL’s first major solo exhibition and confirms his place at the leading edge of a new generation of Australian artists.&lt;/p&gt;

– Tokyo Art Beat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music of multi-instrumental sound artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/aaaaasunaaaaa/&quot;&gt;ASUNA&lt;/a&gt; has reshaped multiple facets of the experimental music scene of Japan, from ambient and drone to improvisation. His landmark work 100 Keyboards is a site-specific listening experience in which one hundred cheap plastic keyboards play the same key, generating an undulating sonic harmony both mesmerising and mysterious. The crowd of sounds comes to take on its own kind of mass, while subtle acoustic variations emerge, hover and retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 90s ASUNA has created experimental sound works that vault genre divides, crossing from hip hop to hardcore punk to freak folk noise and low-fi pop. His performances might feature sound sources as diverse as popping candy, wind-up toys and kazoos, but the playfulness of his compositions belie the profound sensibilities of a true avant-garde artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://melbournefringe.com.au/event/this-is-grayson/&quot;&gt;THIS IS GRAYSON&lt;/a&gt; is the story of a little girl who lives between worlds. She wants to show you who she meets and what she sees. She wants you to know what it’s like to live in the in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just for kids and not just for adults, THIS IS GRAYSON is for both to experience together. Gold Satino are making the show that they needed when they were young queers, awkward outsiders yearning for someone to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will meet a woman at The SUBSTATION. She will take you to a bus and you will go on an intimate, surreal and immersive journey through Newport’s forgotten lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring your sense of adventure and your curiosity, and let Grayson show you the things hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound or signal is reflected causing a large number of reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space – which could include furniture, people, and air. This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they reach zero amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a 2 year hiatus and sell out shows across the globe, &lt;a href=&quot;http://detroittechnomilitia.com/&quot;&gt;Detroit Techno Militia&lt;/a&gt; return to Australian soil to deliver another high impact performance of 2 x 4 which is a combined ensemble performance by T.Linder &amp;amp; DJ Seoul playing 100% vinyl only on 2 mixers and 4 turntables at the same time - no computers or controllers at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus T.Linder is going to unleash his arsenal of signature electro bass form the legendary AUX 88, Drexciya and Kraftwerk through to modern masters like Dj Godfather, Will Web and the man himself T.Linder with a killer solo performance that’s not to be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
