Wolf inhabits a series of richly compelling personas throughout CHORUS, to evoke the ancient Greek Mythological space and speak to the way current politics is played out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a shapeshifting chorus of camp figures, Wolf critically engages with the pleasures and dangers of vanity, ambition, greed, morality, chaos and mischief. Through surreal visuals and magnetic soundscape, CHORUS offers visitors an opportunity to reckon with the power associated with voice, both individual and in unison – our own and others – as we observe, interpret and report on human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does gossip enforce notions of what is proper and what is shameful?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.savage-amusement.com/about-savage-amusement&quot;&gt;Melanie Jame Wolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an Australian born artist who lives and works between Melbourne and Berlin. She makes work about economies. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Always exploring systems of value and exchange, particularly as they occur in the murky field of immaterial capital – the social, the cultural, the affective. She investigates these flows as they are produced through ideas of ghosts, of gender, of pop, of myth, of morality, of sensuality, of class.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcHdxTj00I&quot;&gt;William Basinski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a classically trained musician and composer who has been working in experimental media for over 30 years in NYC and most recently, California. Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time.&lt;/p&gt;

Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. By means of synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Melbourne’s sparkling CBD towers in the rearview mirror, the West Gate freeway is an artery through rapidly changing industrial and suburban landscapes. ‘This is what’s left of the West Gate’ examines the region by drawing upon satellite images to reveal a not just a landscape featuring the massive infrastructure of industrial and manufacturing industries but coastal wetlands, housing, parklands and sports fields, shipping and cleared ‘ghost sites’, evidence of past industrial histories, all laid out along a lacelike network of creeks, roads and railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIN DIXON-WARD’s jewellery reflects the impact of the changing role of the western suburbs using technologies of the ‘next industrial age’. Using the same tools that are used to design cities, and buildings to design jewellery but on a micro scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Myhr’s solo performances are hypnotic. At once virtuosic and gestural, the sound world slowly unfolds as harmonics are gradually shifted through minute changes to a continuous strumming pattern. His performances have been described as “an orchestral exploration of the 12-string guitar sounding like something in between American folk strumming and 60s avant-garde soundness orchestral music.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phFRdRN-H1A&quot;&gt;LISTEN

Based in Berlin for over two decades he has made his fame with iconic group, The Necks, which was recently called “the greatest trio on earth” by the New York Times.
