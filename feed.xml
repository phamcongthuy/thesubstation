&lt;p&gt;CHORUS explores Greek mythology through an immersive multiscreen and sound installation. Drawing its title from the group of performers in Greek theatre whose role it is to comment on the action, this darkly humorous work invites visitors to think about the role of gossip in culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the videos performance artist Melanie Jame Wolf’s inhabits a series of electrifying personas from ancient Greek mythology. These female deities – representing virtues and ideas ranging from love, beauty, wisdom to chaos – are inhabited by the artist with camp abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using overlapping speech and sound and theatrical visual techniques to create a cacophonous soundscape, CHORUS embraces flamboyance, theatricality and a joyfully pop sensibility while exploring serious questions about Western civilisation. How do we interpret and report on human behaviour? In what way do our voices – in unison – enforce cultural attitudes? How does gossip enforce notions of properness and shame?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.savage-amusement.com/about-savage-amusement&quot;&gt;Melanie Jame Wolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an Australian born artist who lives and works between Melbourne and Berlin. She makes work about economies. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Always exploring systems of value and exchange, particularly as they occur in the murky field of immaterial capital – the social, the cultural, the affective. She investigates these flows as they are produced through ideas of ghosts, of gender, of pop, of myth, of morality, of sensuality, of class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join two renowned international composers on a haunting and mesmerising sonic journey. New York based, composer and musician William Basinski performs his only Australian solo performance in a double bill with Berlin-based Italian composer Caterina Barbieri in her first live performance in Australia following appearances at prestigious festivals Berlin Atonal and Unsound (Krakow). These two giants of experimental sound create hypnotic sonic experiences – minimal, mysterious and meditative – using synthesizers and obsolete analogue technologies that will expand your sense of time, space and self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcHdxTj00I&quot;&gt;William Basinski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a classically trained musician and composer who has been working in experimental media for over 30 years in NYC and most recently, California. Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aH1HGzCUc&quot;&gt;Caterina Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an Italian composer now based in Berlin. Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. By means of synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Melbourne’s sparkling CBD towers in the rearview mirror, the West Gate freeway is an artery through rapidly changing industrial and suburban landscapes. ‘This is what’s left of the West Gate’ examines the region by drawing upon satellite images to reveal a not just a landscape featuring the massive infrastructure of industrial and manufacturing industries but coastal wetlands, housing, parklands and sports fields, shipping and cleared ‘ghost sites’, evidence of past industrial histories, all laid out along a lacelike network of creeks, roads and railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIN DIXON-WARD’s jewellery reflects the impact of the changing role of the western suburbs using technologies of the ‘next industrial age’. Using the same tools that are used to design cities, and buildings to design jewellery but on a micro scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first art museums were spaces of conquest when they weren’t showcasing items pillaged from Non European cultures, it was the very bodies of those people put on display. Taungurung visual artist STEVEN RHALL dismantles the gallery as imperial machine, calling into question the very idea of Aboriginal Art as a classification in a series of installations which interrogate various contexts surrounding First Nation art practice and, it’s presentation for a public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located at the flashpoints of the European art canon and First Nations art practice, RHALL’s work roams across forms – performance, video, text and photography – and in recent years his playful and thought-provoking creations have been seen in the National Gallery of Victoria, ACCA and the Centre for Contemporary Photography. DEFUNCTIONALISED AUTONOMOUS OBJECTS is RHALL’s first major solo exhibition and confirms his place at the leading edge of a new generation of Australian artists.&lt;/p&gt;

– Tokyo Art Beat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music of multi-instrumental sound artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/aaaaasunaaaaa/&quot;&gt;ASUNA&lt;/a&gt; has reshaped multiple facets of the experimental music scene of Japan, from ambient and drone to improvisation. His landmark work 100 Keyboards is a site-specific listening experience in which one hundred cheap plastic keyboards play the same key, generating an undulating sonic harmony both mesmerising and mysterious. The crowd of sounds comes to take on its own kind of mass, while subtle acoustic variations emerge, hover and retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 90s ASUNA has created experimental sound works that vault genre divides, crossing from hip hop to hardcore punk to freak folk noise and low-fi pop. His performances might feature sound sources as diverse as popping candy, wind-up toys and kazoos, but the playfulness of his compositions belie the profound sensibilities of a true avant-garde artist.&lt;/p&gt;
