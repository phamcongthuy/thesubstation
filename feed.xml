&lt;p&gt;Directed by acclaimed choreographer GIDEON OBARZANEK, two very different artists collide as they are pitted against one another, taking an abrasive look at the things that divide and unite us. Touching on themes including gender, sexuality, psychology and age, EDWARDES and CILLI will take aim at our desire to connect despite our differences.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">Described as the ‘sorceress of percussion’, celebrated Sydney-based percussionist CLAIRE EDWARDES unites with Helpmann award-winning dancer and choreographer RICHARD CILLI in a new physically virtuosic work.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thesubstation.org.au/uploads/richard.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Linda Tegg</title><link href="https://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/linda-tegg/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Linda Tegg" /><published>2017-05-30T10:42:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-05-30T10:42:00+10:00</updated><id>https://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/linda-tegg</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/linda-tegg/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lindategg.com/&quot;&gt;LINDA TEGG&lt;/a&gt;’s work explores where ecology and illusion intersect, examining the imagery that informs our idea of what is ‘natural’.

&lt;p&gt;Disturbingly obvious and tantalisingly strange, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backtobacktheatre.com/projects/democratic-set/&quot;&gt;THE DEMOCRATIC SET&lt;/a&gt; uses a custom-made film set and a neutral room with two opposing doors. Authoring a unique living snapshot of a community at a particular moment in time, THE DEMOCRATIC SET invites each participant to untangle what an uncensored space means to them, with each viewer surprised and seduced by the mysterious, funny, poignant and provocative sets as they pan the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

At times the audience sees through the glass but the dancer and drummer cannot see out, and at others, the audience can only see themselves reflected back from the mirrored glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performers are alone, in public. This unusual sense of privacy changes their demeanor while the audience takes on an ordained voyeurism, transcending the usual performer-viewer relationship. By doing away with narrative and melody, and making a constantly “in flux” relationship to the public, attention is focused on the agency of the drumming and dancing and the audience. MORE UP A TREE reveals the meaningful nature of movement by removing tonality and concentrating action inside a box.&lt;/p&gt;
