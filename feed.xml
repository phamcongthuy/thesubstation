&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/charlemagne-palestine-carillon-bells&quot;&gt;CHARLEMAGNE PALESTINE&lt;/a&gt; is a critically acclaimed artist exploring the transcendent potentials of music. Working across questions of resonance and duration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bulibjyaQ0s&amp;amp;t=1247s&quot;&gt;PALESTINE&lt;/a&gt;’s works for piano, organ, carillon and voice are defining moments in the 20th and 21st Century, exploring states of trace realised through music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work with organ specifically has created some of the most harmonically rich and intense explorations for that instrument. PALESTINE will deliver a powerful performance for organ and voice on the historic organ of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Williamstown, working with the architecture of the space to explore harmony, overtones and the very resonance of music itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KIM MYHR has an established reputation as one of the industries leading contemporary innovators, creating arresting compositions for chamber ensembles, electroacoustic settings and various theatrical projects.

For the first time in Australia, KIM MYHR performs redefining solo works for the 12 string guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MYHR has performed solo at some of the most significant festivals and venues in Europe, establishing his reputation as one of the instrument’s leading contemporary innovators. The WIRE called MYHR’s first release, ALL YOUR LIMBS SINGING (SOFA) as “a delirious love letter to the 12-string guitar.” And in 2016, MYHR released a collaborative album with JENNY HVAL and TRONDHEIM JAZZ ORCHESTRA, “IN THE END HIS VOICE WILL BE THE SOUND OF PAPER” which was described as “…a grotesquely beautiful paradox of sound, pleasing to the last.” – Slug Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MYHR will be joined by trail-blazing trumpeter and sound artist, PETER KNIGHT with a performance of ALLOTROPE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALLOTROPE, that is, the varying atomic states of a physical form (Carbon; Graphite, Diamond) is KNIGHT’s solo piece created using trumpet, laptop electronics, amplifier and pedals. ALLOTROPE explores KNIGHT’s multidisciplinary preoccupation with space, understatement and long form structure, which draws inspiration from a diverse range of sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peterknightmusic.com/&quot;&gt;PETER KNIGHT&lt;/a&gt;, who has been described as, “Hard to categorise… hauntingly memorable” (The Wire, UK) has toured as a solo artist to major festivals and venues around the world,&lt;/p&gt;

One hundred apocalypses. Sixty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Big Bang and hurtling through wars, famines, kingdoms collapsing, extinctions and dictatorships, APOKALYPSIS establishes a narrative of the world as one of repeated annihilation and overcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As history speeds towards the present day and energy and resources diminish, what emerges is a hallucinogenic vision of a world on the brink of total collapse. This is contemporary Western society: people with the tools, intelligence and power to change the course of the planet, but who can’t find the will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump cutting between genres and underpinned by a gradually evolving live score, APOKALYPSIS is a high octane, searing indictment of denialism and our inability to work together in this extraordinary moment in time: the eve of the Anthropocene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shireentaweel.com/&quot;&gt;SHIREEN TAWEEL&lt;/a&gt; is an artist based at the Parramatta Artist Studios. Her creative practice continues a long tradition that involves the act of marking and piercing copper. This process stretches throughout history and across cultures, but is intimately connected to TAWEEL’s contemporary experience of being a migrant of Muslim and Lebanese heritage living in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gestures that TAWEEL marks into copper are suggestive of an art form steeped in tradition, but are explored through new perspectives, placing emphasis on the global experience of migration, movement and multiculturalism. The resulting works contribute to a cross-cultural discourse of shared histories and experiences between diverse communities and cultural groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the work, YOU’RE STANDING IN IT, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandacarrcreative.com/&quot;&gt;AMANDA CARR&lt;/a&gt; forces fluids into a microscopic void between parallel planes to observe the instability produced by differing surface tensions. This phenomenon, known as Hele-Shaw flow, produces a visual landscape that is as foreign as it is familiar, imaginary in appearance yet undeniably natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARR’s artistic practice transfers the image onto fabric to craft wearable designs, distorting scale and distinction between background and foreground. The human illusion of autonomy enveloped in a volatile terrain forged through a collision of opposing forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, Lawrence English has been one of the leading international voices in field recording. Working extensively across the world, from Antarctica to the Outback and the Amazon to Japan, his recordings display an utterly personal approach informed equally by technique,
theoretical investigations and aesthetic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these unique approaches to field recording that form the basis of this masterclass. The Radical Listener sees Lawrence English guide participants through the specific techniques of field recording and listening he employs in his work. Participants can be at any stage of their interest in field recording from beginner to expert and can use any recording device they have
available (iphone through to profession set ups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join LAWRENCE ENGLISH for a workshop in field recording, sound documentation, manipulation and archiving around The SUBSTATION’s surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
