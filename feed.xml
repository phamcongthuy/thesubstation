&lt;p&gt;During this residency, they will work on a new sound-visual interactive setup and performance model, working title All The Feedback We Ever Had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madeleine Flynn and Tim Humphrey are Australian artists who create unexpected situations for listening. Their work is driven by a curiosity and questioning about sound in human culture and seeks to evolve and engage with new processes and audiences, through public and participative interventions. In 2017 their practice was awarded the national Australia Council Award for Emerging and Experimental Artforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their work has been presented and commissioned widely internationally including Theater Der Welt, Germany: Brighton Festival UK: Sonica Festival Glasgow: Asian Arts Theater, Gwangju: Incheon Art Platform, Seoul: Sydney Festival Australia: Melbourne Festival Australia: AsiaTopa, Melbourne: Perth Festival Australia: MONA FOMA Australia: Kennedy Center, Washington USA amongst many others. Their current areas of interest are existential risk, artificial intelligence in public space, and long form socially engaged public art interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;HAYLEY MILLAR-BAKER  is a Gunditjmara woman from Victoria, Australia. Through contemporary approaches to photography, she draws strength from her Gunditjmara bloodlines, history, and the landscape – confronting and crafting past, present, and future stories of South-East Aboriginal existence, and honouring the connectedness of intergenerational experiences of Aboriginality. &lt;/p&gt;

A prolific creator – he has released hundreds of recordings in a range of musical styles – he has collaborated with musicians from around the globe in a rich and varied career characterised by inventiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live, &lt;strong&gt;Merzbow’s&lt;/strong&gt; sonic works are all consuming; he creates a uniquely physical sound world within which the bodies of his audience are entirely consumed. To describe it as a wall of noise is to understate the experience, &lt;strong&gt;Merzbow’s&lt;/strong&gt; performances generate a universe of noise, infinitely deep, infinitely complex and one that produces profound overstimulation across all spectra of experience, resulting in a euphoria unlike anything else you might hope to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At The SUBSTATION he is joined by the formidable composer and low frequency cultivator &lt;strong&gt;Cat Hope&lt;/strong&gt;, a Perth-based noise, installation and performance artist and founding member of noise duo Lux Mammoth.&lt;/p&gt;
