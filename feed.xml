&lt;p&gt;Disturbingly obvious and tantalisingly strange, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backtobacktheatre.com/projects/democratic-set/&quot;&gt;THE DEMOCRATIC SET&lt;/a&gt; uses a custom-made film set and a neutral room with two opposing doors. Authoring a unique living snapshot of a community at a particular moment in time, THE DEMOCRATIC SET invites each participant to untangle what an uncensored space means to them, with each viewer surprised and seduced by the mysterious, funny, poignant and provocative sets as they pan the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

series of six canvas panels by renowned Melbourne-based artist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ashkeatingartist/&quot;&gt;ASH KEATING&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installed on The SUBSTATION billboards, the work is a broad study of colour and its emotive properties,
with swathes of yellows, reds, pinks, magenta and white fields folding in on one another. Cascading down the surface, each intricate variation across the interconnected panels marks the passing of time spent
spraying, washing and waiting, exposing KEATING’s borderline obsessive commitment to the repetitious
and ritualistic layering of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

At times the audience sees through the glass but the dancer and drummer cannot see out, and at others, the audience can only see themselves reflected back from the mirrored glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performers are alone, in public. This unusual sense of privacy changes their demeanor while the audience takes on an ordained voyeurism, transcending the usual performer-viewer relationship. By doing away with narrative and melody, and making a constantly “in flux” relationship to the public, attention is focused on the agency of the drumming and dancing and the audience. MORE UP A TREE reveals the meaningful nature of movement by removing tonality and concentrating action inside a box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chamber jazz orchestra expands with the additions of turntables, reel-to-reel tape machines and live signal processing, while the sounds of acoustic instruments and voices are interwoven with vinyl-cut field recordings, toying with perceptions of what is heard and what has only been imagined. This layered sound world is further augmented by multiscreen projections as time folds into itself, leaving the residue of moments half-remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring the spaces between the avant-garde and the traditional, art and popular music since 1994, AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA is fired by the same spirit of restlessness that drove the earliest pioneers of jazz to produce music that defined the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
