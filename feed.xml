&lt;p&gt;Together they will develop a new performance work through their shared collaborative devising process.

One, a dance and media public art project that links incidental spectators with large-scale video dance projections and mobile image technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research associates include VICKI VAN HOUT, PATRICK LUCKY LARTEY, ANNA TREGLOAN &amp;amp; MARTIN FOX. The second project in collaboration with PROFESSOR HOLGER DEUTER from the University of Applied Sciences in Kaiserslautern, Germany, researches the theme of weapons design and media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

Her work explores the relationship between dance and the moving image, space and light.

Based about an hour north of Glasgow, Cove Park offers residencies that respond to the diversity of contemporary artistic practice of all art forms. In 2017, Cove Park will host Sydney-based sound artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gailpriest.net/&quot;&gt;GAIL PRIEST&lt;/a&gt;. PRIEST’s work comprises solo electro-acoustic performance and recordings, sound installations for gallery contexts, sound design for performance and video, as well as curation, critique and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
