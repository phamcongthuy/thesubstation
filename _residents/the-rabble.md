[THE RABBLE](http://therabble.com.au/) is an on-going conversation between its artistic directors KATE DAVIS & EMMA VALENTE about aesthetic, space, gender, theatre and representation.

THE RABBLE was formed in 2006, and is one of Australia’s leading avant-garde contemporary theatre companies. THE RABBLE aim to centralise marginalised voices and ideas by boldly ignoring linear and dominant systems of representation. THE RABBLE re-imagine familiar text and stories through a surreal and feminist lens.
