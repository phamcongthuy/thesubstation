The SUBSTATION is seeking expressions of interest from Victorian-based individual artists, artist groups and companies to join our current list of Resident Artists for 2018.  
 
The SUBSTATION presents an annual curated program of creative development, residencies and presentation. Engaging with artists from across artistic disciplines, working in non-traditional modes and across art-forms, we provide the opportunity for artists and audiences to connect with our unique space and distinctive location in Newport in the west of Melbourne. 
 
Our 100-year-old repurposed, industrial building houses a visual arts gallery, rehearsal studio and large-scale performance space. We encourage artists to engage with our post-industrial space and foster a culture of interconnectedness, collaboration and independence, where we value new ideas, imagination and difference. Our artistic program includes significant investment in the creation of new work by artists from across artforms and a commitment to a collaborative relationship between artists and presenter.

Current Resident Artists include radical feminist theatre makers THE RABBLE; emerging visual artist and designer Zarnie Morcombe aka PLASTIC LOAVES; photographer and costume designer Amanda Carr; and choreographer ANTONY HAMILTON. Our Resident Program provides a subsidised, long-term, exclusive studio/office space and the consideration to develop and stage work as part of our curated program.

There are currently several office/studio spaces available that are 4.4m x 3.7m in size. The monthly rent of these spaces is $350 per month. Resident artists have 24-hour access and the rent includes all amenities (except phone). Resident artists also have the possibility to access other areas of the building for free including rehearsal space, gallery space and meeting rooms. 

For further information, please contact Kali Michailidis, General Manager on 03 9391 1110.
