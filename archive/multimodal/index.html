September 4.</p> <p>MULTIMODAL guides randomly selected audience members through a series of physical, sonic, olfactory and choreographic experiences housed within The SUBSTATION’s various post-industrial spaces.</p> <p>Those selected, contribute to the work’s unfolding content as they journey through BYRON SCULLIN’s visceral sonic experiences, physical movement spaces and immersive, scent laden installations from visual artist LIZ HENDERSON and LEE SERLE <strong>,</strong> eliciting memories and personal narratives throughout the performance ritual.</p> <p>Performers DEANNE BUTTERWORTH, BENJAMIN HANCOCK, GEOFFREY WATSON and REBECCA JENSEN, together with eight guides, lead the inductees through the installation series - blurring the lines between performer and audience, and public and private space, as the ritual’s voyeurs (the audience) observe their performance induction from afar.</p> <p><a href="SubstationShowProgram-Multimodal-v1.3.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE SHOW PROGRAM HERE</a></p> <h2 id="about-the-artists">About the artists</h2> <p><a href="http://www.leeserle.com/"><strong>LEE SERLE</strong></a> is a New York and Melbourne based choreographer, performer and teacher. He creates work in varied contexts and forms; including dances for the stage, site-specific, interactive performance installations, and intimate solo works. SERLE has been commissioned to create new works for the Lyon Opera Ballet, Sydney Dance Company, Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, Lucy Guerin Inc., Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA), Dancenorth, Next Wave, and the Victorian College of the Arts presenting new work in Australia, USA, France and Lebanon.</p> <p>SERLE was Protégé in Dance for the prestigious Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative 2010-11; mentored by seminal American choreographer Trisha Brown in New York. Through this initiative he created and performed new work with the company, and toured within the USA and internationally.

An inaugural recipient of the Australia Council for the Arts, Creative Australia Fellowship in 2012, SERLE embarked on a research and development period for 2 years of solo choreographic practice in Melbourne, New York and Beirut; Mentored by Tere O’Connor (New York).

Operating in an ambiguous space where sound transitions into noise, SCULLIN’s sonic environments offer an experience of mass and multiplicity, often representing attempts to hear the unhearable.</p> <p>After an interest in synthesis at a young age, SCULLIN was mentored by producer and composer Francois Tetaz. He has since been involved in almost all aspects of audio in his twenty year career, contributing sound to feature films such as Wolf Creek, contemporary dance productions by Lucy Guerin, Gideon Obarzanek, and Lee Serle, and theatre works by David Chisholm, Chamber Made Opera, and Arena Theatre Co. He also works as a sound educator at RMIT and Melbourne University. A prolific collaborator, SCULLIN has worked closely with audio-visual artist Robin Fox and video artist Daniel Crooks, as well as Australian composers Anthony Pateras, Marco Fusinato, and Oren Ambarchi. He’s also helped realise sound for notable international artists including Bernard Parmegiani, Tony Conrad, and Steven O’Malley.</p> <p><a href="http://hancockbenjamin.tumblr.com/"><strong>BENJAMIN HANCOCK</strong></a> is a young Melbourne-based dancer and choreographer.
